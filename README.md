# HarmonizedRaceHeights-Patcher
Synthesis patcher for my mod Harmonized Race Heights which is also a requisite.

## How it works
The winning override of your mods will be patched with the heights values of the various races from `Harmonized Race Heights.esp`.

So to be sure to keep the plugin of my mod very high and consider using the patches for USMP and High Poly Head Vampire fix from the nexus page if needed.

## Typical usage
So you will have for example:

`Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esm -> Unofficial Skyrim Modders Patch.esm -> Harmonized Race Heights.esp -> ... -> *Harmonized Race Heights patches* -> *Eventual race overhaul mod* -> ... -> Synthesis.esp`

This would be the ideal plugin order for this synthesis patcher to be run that will result in everything getting forwared in the Synthesis.esp file correctly.
